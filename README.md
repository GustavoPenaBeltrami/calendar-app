This project is a **MERN** application that consists of an event manager in a calendar. It allows multiple users to view the same template with all the participants' events, but they can only edit and publish events under their own name.

I made it as a final project, it includes user authentication with tokens, along with corresponding login and register functionalities. The structure of events is based on a simple CRUD operations using MongoDB.

The front-end interface [Here](https://github.com/GustavoPenaBeltrami/calendar-app-front).
